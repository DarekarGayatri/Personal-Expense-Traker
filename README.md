# Personal Finance Dashboard

## Description
The **Personal Finance Dashboard** is a web application designed to help users track their financial transactions, including income, expenses, and investments. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application provides a user-friendly interface for managing personal finances and visualizing financial data through charts.

### Key Features:
- **Transaction Input**: Users can enter financial transactions by specifying the amount and selecting a category (Income, Expense, or Investment).
- **Financial Summary**: Displays the total amounts for income, expenses, and investments, allowing users to quickly assess their financial status.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Chart.js to create a bar chart that visually represents the financial overview, updating dynamically as transactions are added.

### Code Structure:
- **HTML**: The structure includes input fields for entering transaction amounts, a dropdown for selecting categories, and a canvas element for rendering the financial chart.
- **CSS**: The styling provides a clean and modern look with a centered layout, rounded corners, and subtle shadows for depth.
- **JavaScript**: The script manages the financial data, updates the UI with totals, and refreshes the chart whenever a new transaction is added.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter a transaction amount, select a category, and click "Add Transaction" to update your financial summary and chart.

This project serves as a practical example of managing state in a web application and visualizing data using charts, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to improve their financial literacy and management skills.
